# Model Inference
Good practices: 
- `DONE` The model inference should be dynamic libraries that don't depend on ROS
- `DONE` Whatever links model inference don't have to again depend on external libraries (LibTorch)
- `TODO` Add options in CMakeLists.txt to alternatively build as a ROS node 

# Check List
- YoloV5 ONNX support
