# Launching zed ROS 2 driver
ros2 launch zed_wrapper zed_camera.launch.py camera_model:=zed2i
```

# Set up
Check if the camera is connected using any camera app (there are `vlc` or `cheese`)

Run the zed ROS 2 driver

# Problem Log
- Latency in image transmission - high even when streaming raw images without ROS, possible solutions are
    - GST image transmission pipeline
    - To improve performance with ROS, use Zero-Copy 
- Examine why the zed docker provided by [Stereolabs](wiki/DOCKER_ZED_ROS2_WRAPPER.md) doesn't work

# Working Setup
Long Train's [Dockerfile](zed_2i_LONG/zed-2i-LONG.Dockerfile) 

## Fixme
- Resolve @TODO's
- It has to setup everytime the container is restarted
```bash
[component_container_isolated-2] [2024-12-04 22:26:08 UTC][ZED][INFO] [Init]  No calibration file found for SN 28503076. Downloading... 
[component_container_isolated-2] [2024-12-04 22:26:08 UTC][ZED][INFO] [Init]  Calibration file downloaded.
```
- A lot of setup when loading model:
